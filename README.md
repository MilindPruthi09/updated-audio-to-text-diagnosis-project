# updated-audio-to-text-diagnosis-project

In order to maintain the projectâ€™s system architecture as simple as possible and make it easier for others to understand, it has been carefully examined and planned. The system is made up of five main parts. These modules are: 

1. Audio Capture and converting it into text by using Transfer Learning 
2. Filter words from the converted text using Natural Language Processing 
3. Training the Machine Learning Model on the Columbia Dataset 
4. Testing and calculating the probability of disease being correctly inferred 
5. Calling the above functions to be integrated together and showcasing the result with respective API call detailing the disease description.
